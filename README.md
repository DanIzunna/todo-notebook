# Todo Notebook - React App

A sleek, mobile-friendly Todo application built with **React** and **Material UI (MUI)**.  
This app supports task creation, completion, deletion, timestamps, and local persistence. Perfect for daily task management or as a portfolio project.

## Features

- Add, complete, and delete tasks with a single click.
- Tasks are **persisted in localStorage**, so they remain after page refresh.
- **Timestamps** for each task to track creation time.
- **Notebook-style design** with responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
- Task counter in the header for quick overview.
- Modern, polished UI built entirely with **Material UI**.
- Empty state placeholder when no tasks exist.
- Footer includes **GitHub link** for source code reference.
